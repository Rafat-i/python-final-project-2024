# Issue: Incorrect Budget Progress Display

## Problem Description
- **What was the unexpected behavior?**
  The progress bar for each category was not displaying the correct progress. 
  Specifically, it was sometimes showing a green bar even when the total spent exceeded
  the monthly budget. This happened despite the logic in the code that was supposed 
  to color the progress bar red if spending exceeded the budget.
  
- **What should have happened instead?**
  The progress bar should have dynamically reflected the spending in each category,
  with the color turning red when the total spent exceeded the monthly budget and 
  green when it was within the budget. Additionally, the progress bar should have
  accurately filled according to the percentage of the budget spent.

- **How was this issue discovered?**
  This issue was discovered while testing the monthly budget overview feature.
  After adding a few expenses that exceeded the budget for a category, the progress bar
  did not change its color to red, indicating an issue with the logic controlling the 
  progress bar's color and width.

## Root Cause Analysis
- **What was the underlying cause?**
  The root cause was an error in the conditional logic used to calculate the progress 
  bar's color and width. The formula for calculating the percentage of the budget spent 
  (`(category['total_spent']|float / category['monthly_budget']|float * 100)`) was
  correct, but the logic that determined the bar's color was not being properly 
  executed when the spending exceeded the budget.

- **What assumptions were incorrect?**
  The assumption was that the `category['total_spent']` value would always be
  less than or equal to the `category['monthly_budget']`. This assumption led to 
  the code incorrectly treating all categories as "under budget" even if spending
  exceeded the budget.
  
- **What dependencies were involved?**
  This issue was dependent on the data provided in the `budget_overview` and how
  the values for `total_spent` and `monthly_budget` were passed to the template. 
  The logic within the template, especially in the progress bar section, was also a 
  key dependency.

## Resolution
- **How was it fixed?**
  The issue was fixed by adding more robust conditional logic within the progress 
  bar's HTML template. Specifically, the code now checks if the total spending exceeds 
  the monthly budget and adjusts the color and width of the progress bar accordingly.
  
- **What changes were made?**
  The code inside the `<div class="progress-bar-filled">` was updated to:
  ```html
  <div class="progress-bar-filled"
       style="background-color: {% if category['total_spent']|float > category['monthly_budget']|float %}red{% else %}green{% endif %};
              width: {{ [progress, 100] | min }}%;"></div>

## Prevention
- **How can similar issues be prevented?**
  To prevent similar issues, it's important to ensure that the logic controlling dynamic 
  styling and calculations is thoroughly tested with edge cases. 
  Additionally, checking the data passed to templates can help avoid discrepancies in calculations.

- **What lessons were learned?**
  The lesson learned was that assumptions about data validity can lead to issues 
  in UI behavior. Always verify that the data used for dynamic content rendering 
  (like the progress bar) accurately reflects the underlying values.

- **What warning signs should be watched for?**
  Watch for instances where logic in the template doesn't align with the 
  expected results when performing calculations or updating the UI based on user input. 
  If the UI doesn't reflect the expected behavior (e.g., a progress bar isn't updating 
  or showing the wrong color), it may be due to misapplied logic or assumptions in the code.
